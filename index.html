<h2>BITCOIN'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS</h2>
<p>Bank of America list 10 important issues  about bitcoin:</p>
<h3>About 95% of bitcoin is controlled by 2.4% of accounts</h3>
<p>Bitcoin suffers from a concentration ownership ratio with about 95 percent of total bitcoin in circulation owned by just 2.4 percent of addresses with the largest balance. In comparison, the latest Fed data suggests that the top 1 percent of Americans control about 30.4 percent of all household wealth in the U.S. This” makes it impractical” to have bitcoins as a payment mechanism or even an investment vehicle.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin remains very volatile</h3>
<p>Even after a decade of trading, bitcoin remains very volatile, which makes it difficult to use it as a means of payment or store of value. Its volatility is even worse than many emerging markets’ foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin is largely exchanged in dollars</h3>
<p>More than 80 percent of bitcoin is exchanged in dollars, while other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen and the South Korean won account for 19 percent, 0.01 percent and 0.43 percent of bitcoin trading, respectively.</p>
<h3>Artificial scarcity of bitcoin is driving prices up</h3>
<p>Capping bitcoin output at 21 million coins and halving its supply growth every four years has created an artificial scarcity of cryptocurrency. This has made the price rise susceptible to announcements of major institutions buying and miner reward cuts being followed by bitcoin upward moves. Bitcoin trading also remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining) and it’s slow. Bitcoin can handle about 14,000 transactions per hour compared to Visa’s stated 236 million transactions per hour.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin remains illiquid despite price rise</h3>
<p>Bitcoin transactions have remained steady at an average of 287,000 per day as prices rose over the last four years. This means that much of the growth in crypto trading has not resulted in increased bitcoin liquidity.
“</p>
<h3>Bitcoin prices correlated to Google searches</h3>
<p>While correlation does not mean causation, bitcoin prices has been found to correlate with Google searches with increased or reduced searches acting as warnings of price movements.
</p>
<h3>Bitcoin is an environmental disaster, Bank of America says</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a major environmental disaster as its prices are directly correlated to its energy consumption. Its environmental score is very poor. The bitcoin network emits about 60 million tons of carbon dioxide — the same as Greece.
</p>
<h3>Central bank digital currencies are a threat to bitcoin</h3>
<p>With a number of central banks already talking about launching their own retail digital currencies that might use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails, bitcoin could quickly lose its flare and fizzle out.
</p>
<h3>Institutional adoption of bitcoin could come with regulations</h3>
<p>With more mainstream institutions adopting bitcoin, more regulations are likely.</p>
<h3>Grayscale (GBTC) is the largest public holder of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Grayscale (GBTC), an open-ended trust that provides exposure to bitcoin, is now the largest public holder of bitcoin. CBTC was launched in September 2013. Its total bitcoin holdings have skyrocketed to about 3.5 percent of the total supply — $31 billion worth.
